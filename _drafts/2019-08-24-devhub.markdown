In this article I will explain (mostly to myself) how to structure a project with different parts in different programming languages including Golang for back-end, Python/Django REST for API and React/React Native for front-ends.

## Project Structure

- `devhub-be` - back-end (spiders, parsers, indexer)
- `devhub-be-api` - RESTful API layer for back-end
- `devhub-fe` - front-end (generic placeholder, later shared components)
- `devhub-fe-web` - front-end (React for web application)
- `devhub-fe-mobile` - front-end (React Native for iOS and Android)
