Personally, as a human, I am fluent in 4 human langauges: English, Russian, Turkish and Azerbaijani. I am able to explain want I mean to another human being.

Also, I am a nerd and love programming. So, my goal is to be fluent also in programming languages: Golang, Python and JavaScript.

Before we dive into details of how, let's clarify the following points:

1. Why Golang, Python and JavaScript?

...

2. What does in include?

Syntax...

3. Current level?

...

I have a goal. I should know syntax of Python, Golang and JavaScript fluently! Inclduing minor differences in versions, future plans and little tricks.

And, the only way to achieve this is to practice. Pracitce periodically and repeatedly. Memorize even little details.

With this article I want to define all aspects of each language and start the process.

Before we dive in to the details I should say, for some people it's really very strange - why these 3 programming languages? Actually I have even more in my list: C/C++ and Rust. But I thought that it will be really ... to start with all of them together.

The thing is, I already use these 3 languages almost on daily base. Since, I am not an expert in Golang and JavaScript, I am usually not satisfied with the quality of the code. So, with this article I am going to rectify the situation.
