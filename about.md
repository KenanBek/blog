Hello, world! My name is Kanan Rahimov, and I am a backend engineer. Go, and Python are my primary programming languages, and I worked on projects from Aeronautical Data Management to online payment platforms.

I live and work in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Currently, I work at [Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thebeatapp/) as an Engineering Team Lead of one of the backend teams in the Pricing domain.

In my free time, I am involved in various engineering-related activities. You can follow me on my Twitter and GitHub account for the recent updates:
