List of some of my publicly available projects.

### GoModCtl

Go command-line tool. Search, Check and Update Go modules.

Check on [GitHub](https://github.com/beatlabs/gomodctl).

### CodeKN.com

CodeKN started as an experiment to learn more about Kubernetes, Golang, and distributed systems. Now, it contains a website and backend system. BE is responsible for fetching web pages, parsing them, and categorizing them. I also had a chance to try a very simple Machine Learning model to identify the article's topic. Everything runs on managed Kubernetes. I use MySQL as persistent storage.

Check [website](https://codekn.com).


### CoderVlogger

I started the CoderVlogger YouTube channel to talk about tech in English and improve my speaking skills. You can find videos about Python, Go, Kubernetes. I also have some videos about React Native, Expo, and Flutter.
