### CodeKN.com

CodeKN started as an experiment to learn more about Kubernetes, Golang, and distributed systems. Now, it contains a website and backend system. BE is responsible for fetching web pages, parsing them, and categorizing them. I also had a chance to try a very simple Machine Learning model to identify the article's topic. Everything runs on managed Kubernetes. I use MySQL as persistent storage.

Check [website](https://codekn.com).
