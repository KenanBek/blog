## Releasing with the GoReleaser

In this Live Coding session, I am going to merge completed [dbui](https://github.com/KenanBek/dbui) pull requests and prepare a new release.

The preparation consists of updating the documentation and then actually releasing using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).

This release of dbui will include:

1. [Improvements on tables preview](https://github.com/KenanBek/dbui/pull/38) from [the last stream](terminal-user-interfaces-in-golang-with-the-view-package.md).
2. Adding support for one more database type - [SQLite](https://github.com/KenanBek/dbui/pull/31).
3. And, some other codebase improvements.
